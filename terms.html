  This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the
  Verifiable Claims space by using specific terms to discuss particular
  concepts. This terminology is included below and linked to throughout the
  document to aid the reader:
</p>

<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable claim|claims">claim</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A statement made by an <a>entity</a> about the <a>subject</a> defined
by an <a>entity profile</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential curator</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a storage vault or personal verifiable
claim wallet, that stores and protects access to a <a>holder's</a>
credentials and verifiable claims.</dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="creators">creator</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The <a>entity</a> that is associated with creating a particular resource.
For example, the key that created a <a>digital signature</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential|credentials">credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of claims that refer to a qualification, achievement, personal quality,
aspect of an <a>entity</a> such as a name, government ID, preferred payment
processor, home address, or university degree typically used to indicate
suitability.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="inspector|inspectors|inspector's|credential inspectors|credential inspector's">credential inspector</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that requests a <a>credential</a> for processing.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential services">credential service</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a <a>credential</a> storage vault or personal
credential wallet, that stores and protects access to a
<a>recipient's</a> credentials.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="CTP">credential transport protocol</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of messages and protocols for issuing, storing, requesting, and
transmitting <a>credentials</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential validation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process that demonstrates the information in a <a>credential</a> is well-formed.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential verification</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process that cryptographically demonstrates the authenticity of a <a>credential</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A portable URI-based identifier, also known as a DID, that is associated with
an <a>entity</a>. These
identifiers are most often used in a <a>credential</a> and are associated
with <a>recipients</a> such that the <a>credential</a> itself can be easily
ported from one <a>identity provider</a> to another without the need to
reissue the <a>credential</a>. An example of a DID is:
<code>did:b6922d8e-20df-4939-95cd-f79375979178</code>
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifier documents|DID document|DID documents">decentralized identifier document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A document that is accessible via an identifier registry and contains information
related to a particular <a>decentralized identifier</a> such as the
associated <a>identity provider</a> and public key information.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>digital signature</dfn></dt>
  <dd>

  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that is in control of a particular <a>credential</a>.
Typically a holder is also the primary subject of the information

transmission of a credential.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identities|identity's">identity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of information that can be used to identify a particular
<a>entity</a> such as a person, organization, concept, or device. An

  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entity documents">entity document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A Web-based document that contains statements about a
particular <a>entity</a>. Entity documents MUST be accessible in
