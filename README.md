## Verifiable Claims Data Model and Representations

This specification describes a data model for a digital entity profile
and a collection of digital entity credentials that assert verifiable
claims about that entity profile. It also describes how to express
that data model in JSON and JSON-LD.

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  While we prefer the creation of issues
and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions often occur
on the
[public-vc-wg](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/)
mailing list as well.
